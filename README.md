Second project for the JS Fundamentals part of the course.

Assignment:

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. Create the divs using JavaScript.
- Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them.
- Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid
